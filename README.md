# Algebraic and Geometry Problem Solving Software

This software is designed to solve algebraic equations, including quadratic and linear systems, as well as geometry problems. Developed using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), it provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for educational and practical use.

## Features

- Solve quadratic and linear algebraic equations with detailed steps.
- Handle systems of linear equations.
- Solve geometry problems.
- Calculating LCM & GCD.
- Built with modern WPF technology for a rich GUI experience.

## Background

The software was developed by Sadra Milani Moghaddam ([Personal Website](https://sadramilani.ir)) in 9th grade with the support and mentorship of Dr. Mostafa Kafaei Razavi ([LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mostafa-kafaei-razavi-24427582/)).

Achievements:
- 1st place in the regional stage the Khwarizmi Programming Festival.
- 1st place in the regional stage of the Khwarizmi Mathematics Festival.
- 3rd place in the provincial stage of the Khwarizmi Mathematics Festival.

## Technologies Used

- WPF (.NET) for the desktop user interface.
- C# programming language.
- MVVM design pattern for maintainability.
